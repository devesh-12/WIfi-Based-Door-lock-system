# Wifi-based-door-lock-system
Used the concept of face recognition by ESP32CAM module interfaced with relay module and Solenoid lock.  â€¢ The Camera-Webserver of ESP32CAM module captures face and sends the data to user using blynk cloud  as IOT for the user to control the door lock using mobile application.
Interfaced a single channel relay module with solenoid lock and the esp32camera module.
The face regocnition and the camera web serever of the camera module detects the face and gives signal to the system to open the solenoid lock.
Further more the data is being shared through blynk IOT application and the user can control the door lock with the application.
